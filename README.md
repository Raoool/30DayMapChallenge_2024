# Fire Hotspots in the Contiguous United States - October 2024

This map visualizes fire hotspots across the contiguous US using NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System) data. It's part of my contribution to the hashtag#30DayMapChallenge!

## Key features:
  - Data source: NASA FIRMS VIIRS_SNPP_NRT
  - Timeframe: October 2024
  - Colormap: Temperature intensity from yellow (cooler) to red (hotter)
  - Basemap: CartoDB Positron for a clean, light background

## Tech stack:
  - Python
  - Libraries: Matplotlib, Geopandas, Contextily
  - API data fetching with requests

This visualization helps identify areas of high fire activity, crucial for resource management and environmental monitoring.
